Molarity Calculator
A simple desktop application for solving molarity (M1V1 = M2V2) chemistry equations, with a user-friendly GUI.

What Does This Project Do?
This tool lets you enter three out of four values (M1, V1, M2, V2) and calculates the missing value using the equation M1V1 = M2V2.
Perfect for quick chemistry homework or lab calculations!

Key Features
Simple GUI: Easy to use, with labeled input boxes and clear results.

Flexible Calculation: Leave any one box empty, and the app will calculate it for you.

Error Handling: Shows helpful error messages if invalid input is entered.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x (Tested on Python 3.9+, but should work on most versions)

Basic knowledge of running Python scripts

Installation
No extra packages are neededâ€”just Python!
If you want to create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
Usage
Run the app:

python app.py
Enter three values (M1, V1, M2, or V2).
Leave one box empty (the value you want to calculate).

Click "Calculate".

View the result at the bottom of the window.
